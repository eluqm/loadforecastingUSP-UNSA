%% Taking the log of a change doesn't usually make sense,
%% unless the circumstances are such that only positive changes can occur. 
%% What is the science that suggests a log annualized change vs log real value of survey mean model? 
%% Would it make sense to look at the logarithm of the ratio of current population living below poverty 
%% threshold to some baseline value? The ratios will always be positive numbers, 
%% and taking logarithms has the advantage of making a doubling and a halving metrically similar.
