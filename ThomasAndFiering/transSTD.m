%   In case the skewness coefficients are biased, 
%   a transformation to reduce the skewness to zero are needed (Salas et al., 1980). 
%   The skewness of the observed data is reduced using log-transformation which can be written as:
%      
%       X_(v,t) = log (Q_(v,t) + c_t.Q2_t)
%       c_t = a /(g^2)_t
%
%    where Q_(v,t) is monthly observed inflow (MCM/month) for month t (t = 1, ..., 12) and year v (v = 1, ..., N);
%    N is number of years of record of the series; 
%    Q2_t is monthly average inflow for month t, 
%    a is a constant; 
%    g_t is the skewness coefficient for the set Q_(1,t), Q_(2,t),..., Q_(N,T); 
%    and X_(v,t) are the normalized inflows, for year v and month t.
