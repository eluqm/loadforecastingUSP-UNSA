function outputWeights =ridge_regression(stateCollectMat, teachCollectMat)

% computes ESN output weights from collected network states and collected 
% teacher outputs. Mathematically this is a linear regression. 
% 
%
%these models relied on regularisation by the ridge regression
%method for good generalisation ability. Using trial-and-error
%testing, a good value of the regularisation parameter Î± (see
%Eq. 8) was found to be 0.1.
